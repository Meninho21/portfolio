                    2012
                    <br>

                    I chose the secondary school Guillaume Kroll, because I learned that I could later join a more IT focused class.
                    It was the only secondary school in Esch that had this specialization.

                    2018
                    <br>
                    In my sixth year of secondary school I finally could make the choice I went to Guillaume Kroll for, to change to Technique Générale Informatique
                    It's still a Technique générale similar to what other secondary schools offer but with a bigger focus on IT.
                    More IT classes,  more in-depth learning of programming, networks and other fields.
                    I had more programming in Java, Database, SQL, Networks, Linux and Electronics classes.

                    2021
                    <br>
                    After graduating secondary school I started my bachelor in IT at the university of Luxembourg.
                    Many classes that were quite interesting. More Java, C, Swift, a little bit of Python with Pyspark.
                    Git, Github, Docker, Kubernetes.
                    We programmed a web game in the style of fruit ninja using the Phaser framework.

                    2025
                    <br>
                    I graduated from the university of Luxembourg with a degree in applied Information Technology.
                    Later that year I joined my former secondary school as an assistant in administration.
                    I schedule appointments, replace teachers, process work and médical documents and help with the day-to-day needs of the teachers and students.

                    In my sixth year of secondary school I had the choice of pursuing a more IT based class, which I obviously had to take.
                    I had more programming in Java, Database, SQL, Networks, Linux and Electronics classes.

                    My first real fascination with technology came through the use of my brother's consoles.
                    Consoles that are now considered retro, but that absolutely blew me away as a child.
                    I quickly grew addicted to gaming.
                    Nintendo Gameboy, Gamecube, Sony PSP, PS3, and I also started having come consoles of my own DS Lite, Wii, DSi, 3DS, Sony PS4.
                    The fascination wasn't limited to consoles though. 
                    My family got themselves our first home computer and the horizon just got wider.
                    My very first feel of the internet.
                    From searches on the World Wide Web to social interaction through MSN, it was all mindblowing at the time.
                    This wasn't where my main interest was though, it was gaming (of course).
                    My brother installed console emulators on it, PS2 and Nintendo 64, and some games.
                    Notably, I started playing Super Mario 64 and Gta San Andreas (Yes, I was nowhere near of age to play it).
                    Around the 3rd year of high school I started experimenting with the use of emulators.
                    I started my first real use of Programming around 3rd year of high school.
                    A program called Scratch to then real programming with Unimozer and shortly after with Netbeans.
                    Java was the very first programming language I have learned at it is also the one I have most years of experience in, at around 15 years old.
                    My studies included SQL, Linux command line, Hardware Electronics, Cisco Packet Tracer Network simualtion and much more.
                    After completing High school I started my Bachelor in IT at the university of Luxembourg.
                    The first year the programming language course, was Java through Visual Studio Code.
                    Consequently Git and Github was also introduced.
                    We had one course that introduced us to Javafx and later Android Studio.
                    The idea of running my own Software on my phone quickly sparked my interest.
                    Later, we started working with Javascript (Typescript), C and Swift.
                    Around 2 year of university, the advent of ChatGPT quickly impacted our entire class.
                    Students that wanted an easy way to pass the course jumped on the opportunity to use it to cheat.
                    Still at its early stages, it became quickly apparent, that it wasn't quite mature yet for coding and so it didn't really work that well.
                    In the cases where AI did work well enough, the university was quick to implement AI detectors to catch the cheaters.
                    First very sceptical of AI and being on the fence about using it for myself, since I couldn't really see it being very useful except for having it do your work and sometimes creating entirely non-working results.
                    It got clear to me that things weren't that simple. I started relying on AI as I kind of a faster way to research information.
                    AI adapts its answers to the user using it, which is much more effective when doing research in specific cases.
                    The more specific your questions are, the more effectively the AI can answer in contrast to a Google search in a wide variety of cases.
                    The time gain from using AI in your work is no joke, but only if it's done correctly.
                    If you aren't learning while you are coding using AI you are very likely using it wrong.
                    AI is best used when it helps you find mistakes that would otherwise take you a long time to find.
                    To suggest ideas of how your work could be done more efficiently.
